  <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>This Creamy Coconut Chicken Curry is delicious, healthy, made in one pot and best of all ready in only 30 minutes! Forget take-out, this is about to become your new family favorite.</p>
  <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chicken</strong> - Skinless, boneless and cubed up into bite sized pieces.</li>
      <li>Olive oil – We want an oil to saute our sauteables in, I love the flavor from olive oil in a recipe like this but you can always also use something light like canola.</li>
      <li>Spices – Just a bit of curry powder today, that’s all you need for this delicious dish!</li>
      <li>Garlic – Use as much or little as you like.</li>
      <li>Onion – Chopped up and ready to be sautéed till perfectly translucent.</li>
      <li>Tomatoes – We want a can of diced tomatoes and some tomato paste to get some of that perfect acidic flavor. I used fire roasted tomatoes because I just love, so if you’ve got them, use them.</li>
      <li>Coconut milk – Just 1 can is all we need for a perfectly creamy, coconut-y curry.</li>
      <li>Sugar – We need a hit of sweetness to combat all the acidic savory flavor we have going on. I just used some granulated white sugar.</li>
      <li>Chicken broth – Low sodium so as to control the sodium content of our curry!</li>
      <li>Seasoning – Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ul>
