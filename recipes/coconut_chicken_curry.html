  <h2 class="heading subsection">Description</h2>
    <p>This Creamy Coconut Chicken Curry is delicious, healthy, made in one pot and best of all ready in only 30 minutes! Forget take-out, this is about to become your new family favorite.</p>
  <h2 class="heading subsection">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chicken</strong> - Skinless, boneless and cubed up into bite sized pieces.</li>
      <li><strong> Olive oil</strong>- We want an oil to saute our sauteables in, I love the flavor from olive oil in a recipe like this but you can always also use something light like canola.</li>
      <li><strong>Spices</strong> - Just a bit of curry powder today, that's all you need for this delicious dish!</li>
      <li><strong>Garlic</strong> - Use as much or little as you like.</li>
      <li><strong>Onion</strong> - Chopped up and ready to be saut√©ed till perfectly translucent.</li>
      <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong> - We want a can of diced tomatoes and some tomato paste to get some of that perfect acidic flavor. I used fire roasted tomatoes because I just love, so if you've got them, use them.</li>
      <li><strong>Coconut milk</strong> - Just 1 can is all we need for a perfectly creamy, coconut-y curry.</li>
      <li><strong>Sugar</strong> - We need a hit of sweetness to combat all the acidic savory flavor we have going on. I just used some granulated white sugar.</li>
      <li><strong>Chicken broth</strong> - Low sodium so as to control the sodium content of our curry!</li>
      <li><strong>Seasoning</strong> - Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2 class="heading subsection">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Cook the chicken</strong>: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven. Add the chicken to the Dutch oven and season with salt and pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink.</li>
      <li><strong>Finish the dish</strong>: Add the onion, garlic, curry powder and stir. Cook for 2 more minutes then add the chicken broth, coconut milk, tomatoes, tomato paste and sugar. Stir everything together, bring to a boil then cover with a lid. Turn the heat down and simmer for another 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
      <li><strong>Garnish and serve</strong>: Garnish with parsley and serve over rice.</li>
    </ol>
