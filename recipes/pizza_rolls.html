  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A Recipe for Pizza Rolls. It is a delicious dish and tastes like a Pizza.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>500g of flour</li>
      <li>15g of salt +  some extra</li>
      <li>1 tsp of sugar</li>
      <li>1 pack of instant yeast (enough for 500g)</li>
      <li>ca. 250ml lukewarm water</li>
      <li>2 tbsp of olive oil</li>
      <li>350g of pureed tomatoes</li>
      <li>75g vegan cheese</li>
      <li>optional: olives, smoked tofu, pineapple, cherry tomatoes...</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix flour and 15g of salt in a big bowl.</li>
      <li>Push a mould into the center of the flour and add yeast and sugar. Mix with a little bit of lukewarm water.</li>
      <li>Cover and let rest for five minutes.</li>
      <li>After five minutes, the yeast should be bubbly. Add the rest of the water and the oil and knead until you get a nice smooth dough. You might need a little extra flour or water to get a perfectly smooth, dough.</li>
      <li>Cover dough and allow to rest for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>You can use the time to cut up whatever you want to fill the rolls with: for example olives, pineapple, smoked tofu or cherry tomatoes...</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 200째C/390째F.</li>
      <li>Roll out dough to a rectangle, not too thick (2-3mm)</li>
      <li>Set aside about 50ml of the pureed tomatoes. Spread the rest on the dough.</li>
      <li>Lightly salt the tomatoes.</li>
      <li>Now add the "stuffing", in my case black olives.</li>
      <li>The next step is rolling up the dough. I try to push down on the sides of the dough, so the sauce doesn't seep out.</li>
      <li>Once your done rolling, cut slices and put then on a baking tray.</li>
      <li>Once on the baking tray, add the rest of the tomatoes on top, as well as vegan cheese.</li>
      <li>Bake at 200째C/390째F for about 22 Minuten.</li>
      <li>Done! :)</li>
